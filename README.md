# IHC-DAB-Nuclei-Analysis
Using Ilastik and Cell Profiler to separate DAB stained objects and nuclei from images

Pipelines are simplified to be labeled as "DAB" and "Nuclei" to make it more accessible for anyone wanting to separate IHC DAB staining.  If more specific labeling, i. e. TDP43, NeuN, GFAP, etc. are desired, it is best to save a separate version with the desired change in labels.
