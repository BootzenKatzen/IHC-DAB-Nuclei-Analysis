# IHC-DAB-Nuclei-Analysis
Using Ilastik and Cell Profiler to separate DAB stained objects and nuclei from images

Labels used are simplified to: "Nuclei," "DAB," "Tissue," and "Other."  This way, it can be used for a variety of projects without relabling each time. Specification of the stain and the tissue can be done during data manipulation.

I do have some copies of this pipeline labelled for various tasks, if there is a more specific request.

DAB - can be labeled as Poly-GA, Poly-GR, TDP43, NeuN, GFAP etc.
Tissue - can be labeled as Brain, Spinal Cord, Heart, etc.
